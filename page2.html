    <pre>
    Bible- A source of information, a directive. It represents all kinds of reading materials that we 
    use. Let us Be Informed Before Life Ends {BIBLE}, and ask God to give us beneficial 
    knowledge.
    The Cross- A symbol of our salvation. It represents all kinds of challenges that we encounter in 
    our glory. We should pray that God grant us humble hearts, perseverance, patience and sincerity

    Let us consider these challenges as bitter pills that we take with gladness to heal us from our 
    iniquities, infirmities and transgressions.
